Once upon a time, 
there were two penguins who were best friends.
They went fishing together, they had there lunch together,
they almost did everything together.
Then on one dark night there was a heavy rains and thunder storm. The two penguins parted.
But the ending is not sad they met each other online.
They initially couldn't recognise eachothers profils.
